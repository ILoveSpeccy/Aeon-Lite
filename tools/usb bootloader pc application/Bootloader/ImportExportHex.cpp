/*
    PIC16Fxx parts use only one address for each FLASH program word. Address 0 has 14 bits of data, Address 1 has
    14 bits of data, etc. However, the PIC16Fxx HEX file addresses each byte of data with a unique address number.
    As a result, you basically have to take the HEX file address and divide by 2 to figure out the actual
    PIC16Fxx FLASH memory address that the byte belongs to.

    Example: PIC16F886 has 8K program words, word addressed as 0 to 0x2000.
        A full HEX file for this part would have 16Kbytes of FLASH data. The HEX file bytes would
        be addressed from 0 to 0x4000.

    This presents a predicament for EEPROM data. Instead of starting from HEX file address 0x2100 as
    the EDC device database might indicate, the HEX file has to start EEPROM data at 0x2000 + 0x2100 = 0x4100,
    to avoid overlapping with the HEX file's FLASH addresses.
