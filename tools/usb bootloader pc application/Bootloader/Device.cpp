//This method is useful for hex file parsing.  This function checks if the address indicated in the hex
//file line is contained in one of the programmable regions (ex: flash, eeprom, config words, etc.), as
//specified by the USB device, (from the query response that we received earlier).  If the address
//from the hex file is contained in the programmage device address range, this function returns
//bool includedInProgrammableRange = true, with the type set to the programmable region type
//(which can be determined based on the address and the query response).  This function also returns
//the new effective device address (not from the .hex file, which is a raw linear byte address, but the
//effective address the device should load into its self programming address registers, in order to
//program the contents [PIC24 uses a 16-bit word addressed flash array, so the hex file addresses
//don't match the microcontroller addresses]).
//This function also returns bool addressWasEndofRange = true, if the input hexAddress corresponded
//to the very last byte of the last address of the programmable memory region that the hexAddress
//corresponded to.  Otherwise this value returns false.  This provides an easy check later to
//know when an end of a region has been completed during hex file parsing.
